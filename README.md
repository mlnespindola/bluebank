# Open Banking project #
- This project was made as a challange for 4cadia.
- *important*: I intend to improve this project soon.
- This project was made with react.js and SASS, since react is the most used framework for js, and Sass is a simple and faster way to write and manage css
- It isn't responsive yet, although I aware of mobile first concept.
- I really cared for the design, but I also worked on implementing the "sign up" feature.
- I'm using a BaaS, firebase, to strealine the proccess, as I haven't learned any backend language so far.

# The structure #
- The landing page has two sections: the homepage and the about section.
- There is a topbar containing the login, register and about anchors.
- All the buttons on the landing page redirect the user either to the register page or the login page.
- the register page is responsible for subscribing the new user. It sends the user data to firebase authentication via SDK.

# To Do #
- I want to improve the overall sass files, I think it could be better, especially the form style, as it will be used again in the login page, so it should be reusable.
- There are a lot of features to implement, but the first is login verification. 
- The dashboard was not ready, but I would like to code a bar chart to show all expenses, add a filter to see each month's expenses, and add a page for each credit card/bank.

# Observations #
- This project was a real challenge, but I really enjoyed developing it.
